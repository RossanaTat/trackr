\title{Generate Speed Path from Predicted Changes}
\usage{
get_speed_path(changes_speed, granularity = 0.1, best = "high", verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{changes_speed}{A data.table containing two columns:
\code{y} (the starting level of the indicator) and
\code{change} (the expected annualized change from that level).}

\item{granularity}{A numeric value indicating the step size used when
computing the trajectory over time. Smaller values produce smoother curves.
Defaults to \code{0.1}.}

\item{best}{A character string indicating the direction of improvement.
Use \code{"high"} (default) if higher values of the indicator are better,
or \code{"low"} if lower values are better. This affects the direction of the path.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), a success message is displayed after computation.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with two columns:
  \item{time}{Cumulative time (in years) needed to reach each step in the path.}
  \item{y}{The corresponding value of the indicator at each time step.}
}
\description{
Computes the expected trajectory (or "speed path") of a variable over time,
based on predicted annualized changes as a function of the variable's initial value.
This is typically used to simulate progress from the worst to the best value
of an indicator
