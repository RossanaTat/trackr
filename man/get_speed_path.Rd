\title{Generate Speed Path from Predicted Changes}
\usage{
get_speed_path(changes_speed, granularity = 0.1, best = "high", verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{changes_speed}{A data.table containing two columns:
\code{y} (the starting level of the indicator) and
\code{change} (the expected annualized change from that level).}

\item{granularity}{A numeric value indicating the step size used when
computing the trajectory over time. Smaller values produce smoother curves.
Defaults to \code{0.1}.}

\item{best}{A character string indicating whether higher or lower values of thei indicator are better. Use "high" if higher values of the indicator reflect better outcomes, or "low" if lower values are better.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), a success message is displayed after computation.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with two columns:
  \item{time}{Cumulative time (in years) needed to reach each step in the path.}
  \item{y}{The corresponding value of the indicator at each time step.}
}
\description{
Computes the expected trajectory (or "speed path") of a variable over time,
based on predicted annualized changes as a function of the variable's initial value.
This is typically used to simulate progress from the worst to the best value
of an indicator
