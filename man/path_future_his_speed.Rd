\title{Project future indicator paths using historical country-specific speeds}
\usage{
path_future_his_speed(
  data_fut,
  scores,
  path_speed,
  best = "high",
  target_year = 2030,
  min = NULL,
  max = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_fut}{Output of `prep_data_fut()`}

\item{scores}{A data.table containing historical speed scores.
Must include columns: `code`, `year`, and `score`}

\item{path_speed}{Output of `get_speed_path()`}

\item{best}{Indicator direction ("high" or "low")}

\item{target_year}{Projection horizon}

\item{min}{Optional lower bound on projected values}

\item{max}{Optional upper bound on projected values}
}
\value{
A data.table with projected indicator values (`y_fut`) by country-year.
  A diagnostics table explaining missing projections is attached as an
  attribute: `attr(x, "diagnostics")`.
}
\description{
This function simulates future indicator trajectories by extending each
country along the global speed path using its own historically observed
speed score.
}
\details{
Missing values (`NA`) in projected outcomes indicate that a historically
anchored future path could not be computed, typically due to missing or
non-positive historical speed estimates or infeasible extrapolation beyond
the modeled indicator range.
