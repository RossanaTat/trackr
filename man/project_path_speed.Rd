\usage{
project_path_speed(
  data_his,
  sequence_speed = c(0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4),
  path_speed,
  granularity = 0.1,
  eval_from = 2000,

}
\arguments{
\item{data_his}{A `data.table` containing historical values with variables `code`, `year`, and `y_his`.}

\item{sequence_speed}{numeric vector of speed paths to calculate}

\item{granularity}{A numeric value indicating the step size used when
computing the trajectory over time. Smaller values produce smoother curves.
Defaults to \code{0.1}.}

\item{eval_from}{The first year to include in the analysis}

\item{eval_to}{The last year to include in the analysis}

\item{min}{A numeric value indicating the minimum bound,}

\item{max}{A numeric value indicating the maximum bound,}

\item{best}{A character string indicating whether higher or lower values of thei indicator are better. Use "high" if higher values of the indicator reflect better outcomes, or "low" if lower values are better.}
}
\value{
A data table of projected values under different speeds
}
\description{
Calculates path a country would have taken with various speeds
}
